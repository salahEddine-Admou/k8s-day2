Master Node(Control Plane): This is the city's brain center, comprising several essential components:

API Server: The command center where you issue orders to Kubernetes.
etcd: Kubernetes memory, a reliable database storing the entire configuration of your cluster.
Controller Manager: The orchestrator, ensuring the desired state of your application is maintained.
Scheduler: The matchmaker, assigning tasks to worker nodes.
Worker Nodes(Data Plane): These are like the city's workforce, each equipped with:

Kubelet: The gatekeeper, ensuring containers are up and running in pods.
Kube Proxy: The traffic cop, managing network communication among pods.
Container Runtime: The construction worker, executing container commands.
